                        <p class="article__text">
                            I would like to begin this article with a ballad to the new and improved Gallery i have created
                            as of this moment i do not have many pictures to include on this section of my website this is due to
                            my battle with covid over the past two weeks aswell as my phone being reset due to repairs made by my phones distrubuter.
                            To add onto that point there was nothing wrong with my phone it had a hardware failure and was deemed unrepairable so i've recieved a replacement.
                            <br><br>
                            Previously the Gallery page was just one large wall of images entirely uncatergorised and hard to manage due to the images being all over the place.
                            Now the Gallery page includes 3 justified pages with a dropdown in the top right-hand corner of the webpage these pages include;
                            Day-to-day-life which is general images of things that i see or wish to take a picture of; Animals, which is as simple as it sounds,
                            but in my case it will most likely be filled with pictures of my dogs and lastly a Selfies Page this is due to the ever expanding ammount of selfies on my phone
                            which can quickly become hard to view and manage, this allows me to pick the best of them all and upload them to one singular
                            unjustified area, it is also a good way for me to view what changes i make in myself.
                            <br><br>
                            Furthermore i have updated the blog layout slightly, this is more of a thing that only i will notice due to it being so small but it is more of a quality
                            of life feature, i have changed the buttons on the blog page and changed the location of the Subtitles and titles for each post.
                            As i said, such a small change its barely noticeable. The new buttons have a much more refined look and allow for better accessability due to their biggersize
                            aswell as them fitting the theme of the page and website more.
                            <br><br>
                            As of Saturday i had finally begin to start testing negative for covid (the line of the covid test was very faint), as of Today
                            i no longer have covid so mostly the past two days i have been chilling out due to the fact that the entire time over the two weeks of me having covid
                            i have been nothing but productive, Making this website, Making a portfolio, making a resume amongst so much more. I really do believe that it is good to take
                            a break from life every now and then and if i could suggest a better way of doing it than burrying yourself in work such as i did.
                            I would suggest to take a 3 day break, use no technology for 3 days wake up, do 100 pushups, have a cold shower and go for a nature walk and repeat this for the
                            course of the three days it will allow you to take a long look at yourself and clear your mind fully, aswell as allow you to set your own ambitions for the future
                            having this course mindset allows for the mind to think more creatively and it also allows your ambitions to be set in stone.
                            <br><br>
                            During the time period of me having covid i have been quite lazy and have completely thrown out my workout, i plan to as of wednesday the 20th of july 2022
                            to reinstate my workout and focus on calisthenics (The reason i say Wednesday is due to the 2 day 30-40 degree heatwave coming to the united kingdom
                            that the met office have issued a red warning for.) i will attempt to talk about my progress on this journey multiple times per week and if i fail at This
                            then trust that i will at least have a progress report each month.
                            For now this is all i have to say.
                            <br><br>
